Generated scaffold notes:
- This scaffold is intended as a starting point. Many backend integration points (Appwrite collections, secure token generation for ZEGO) must be implemented.
- Replace ZEGO and Appwrite placeholders before testing.
- ZEGOCLOUD requires proper appSign or token. For production, generate server-side tokens.
- Gift system includes UI only; implement server-side transactions to validate coin balances.
